# Climate Change AI Summer School
This repository contains learning and files from the Climate Change AI Summer School 2024.

Split into the different lectures and lessons.

Combining my love of the environment, __sustainability__ and the natural world with learning AI and developing my __python__ skills!

## How to Use This Repo 💻

* There is a seperate folder for each week that has a tutorial attached.
* Tutorials contained within Google Colab (.ipynb) files within each sub folder.
* Colab files are from Climate Change AI, however my extra notes and learnings have been added.
* Read through the files to explore and understand everything I have learned over the course of the summer school!

## Lessons & Topics 📚

* __Session 1: Introductions__
* __Session 2: AI for Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use.__

Going through the process of training a deep learning model and applying it to automate the generation of LULC maps, leveraging tools like Pytorch and Google Earth Engine.

* __Session 3: AI for Biodiversity and Ecosystems__

Learning about bioacoustic monitoring using agile modeling techniques. Processing and embedding audio data about birds - which is an ideal task for AI as it would be tedious, time-consuming and difficult for a human!

* __Session 4: AI for Social Sciences, Economics and Policy - Climate Innovation Policy__

Lecture covered the policy and social side of climate and AI whilst the tutorial was on the topic of NLP Models for Climate Policy Analysis (Evidence Synthesis). Tutorial covered understanding the model pipeline for NLP applications in climate policy analysis and evaluating and visualising the models effectively.

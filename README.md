# Climate Change AI Summer School
This repository contains learning and files from the Climate Change AI Summer School 2024.

Split into the different lectures and lessons.

Combining my love of the environment, __sustainability__ and the natural world with learning AI and developing my __python__ skills!

## How to Use This Repo 💻

* There is a seperate folder for each week that has a tutorial attached.
* Tutorials contained within Google Colab (.ipynb) files within each sub folder.
* Colab files are from Climate Change AI, however my extra notes and learnings have been added.
* Read through the files to explore and understand everything I have learned over the course of the summer school!

## Lessons & Topics 📚

* __Session 1: Introductions__

  No tutorial for this one - just an introduction to the course, the basic science behind climate change and an introduction to ML and AI.


* __Session 2: AI for Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use.__

Going through the process of training a deep learning model and applying it to automate the generation of LULC maps, leveraging tools like Pytorch and Google Earth Engine.

* __Session 3: AI for Biodiversity and Ecosystems__

Learning about bioacoustic monitoring using agile modeling techniques. Processing and embedding audio data about birds - which is an ideal task for AI as it would be tedious, time-consuming and difficult for a human!

* __Session 4: AI for Social Sciences, Economics and Policy - Climate Innovation Policy__

Lecture covered the policy and social side of climate and AI whilst the tutorial was on the topic of NLP Models for Climate Policy Analysis (Evidence Synthesis). Tutorial covered understanding the model pipeline for NLP applications in climate policy analysis and evaluating and visualising the models effectively.

* __Session 5: AI for Climate Science__

The lecture explained the fundementals of cliate science - what is is and why climate change is such a huge issue. The tutorial went through one possible application of machine learning; predicting the Niño3.4 index—a key indicator of El Niño events—using historical SST data. The tutorial went through inear regression, random forests, and CNNs and the impact of training on different historical periods on model performance and emphasizes the importance of data quality and model selection in climate forecasting.


* __Session 6: AI for Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification__

A tutorial monitoring coal power plants using a dataset of coal power plants' emissions, including images, metadata and labels. In the tutorial I went through the steps of how to monitor coal power plants, leveraging satellite imagery and computer vision models


* __Session 7: AI for Social Sciences, Economics and Policy, Part II__

No tutorial for this session, instead just a lecture covering how greenhouse gas emissions and climate change will influence the environment (temperature, rainfall, cloud cover, soil moisture) and how will those changes impact on human wellbeing?


* __Session 8: Ethics, Impacts, and Regulation of AI__

No tutorial for this session, instead two lectures covering the ethics and regulation on AI. Included an interesting deep dive on the EU's AI Act.


* __Session 9: AI for Buildings & Cities__

The lecture went through the role of data and AI for climate change mitigation and adaptation in cities. There were three accompanying tutorials; Building Load Forecasting with Machine Learning, using CityLearn and Building Control with RL using BOPTEST.


* __Session 10: GHG Impact Assessment of AI__

There was no tutorial for this session, instead there were two lectures on more 'soft' aspects of cliamet and AI; The GHG Impact Assessment of AI and Responsible AI and Sustainability.

* __Session 11: AI For Power & Energy Systems__

This lecture and tutorial empasised the importnat of energy systems in tackling climate change. The tutorial specifically went through an exercise using artificial intelligence for solving optimal power flow problems in power grids, focusing on a simple neural network model implemented with PyTorch.

# Climate Change AI Summer School
This repository contains learning and files from the Climate Change AI Summer School 2024.

Split into the different lectures and lessons.

Combining my love of the environment, __sustainability__ and the natural world with learning AI and developing my __python__ skills!

## Lessons & Topics 📚

* Session 1: Introductions
* Session 2: AI for Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use

## How to Use This Repo 💻

* There is a seperate folder for each week that has a tutorial attached.
* Tutorials contained within Google Colab (.ipynb) files within each sub folder.
* Colab files are from Climate Change AI, however my extra notes and learnings have been added.
